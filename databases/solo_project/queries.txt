Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM students;
1|Lez|3|1
2|Alex|4|2
3|Tom|49|3
4|Crazy|3|4

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE students
   ...> SET age = 99
   ...> WHERE grades_id = 2;

   sqlite> SELECT * FROM students;
1|Lez|3|1
2|Alex|99|2
3|Tom|49|3
4|Crazy|3|4

Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT students.name, students.age, grades.letters FROM students JOIN grades ON students.grades_id = grades.id;
Lez|3|A
Alex|99|B
Tom|49|C
Crazy|3|D

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT students.name, students.age, grades.letters FROM students
   ...> JOIN grades ON students.grades_id = grades.id
   ...> WHERE students.age > 4;
Alex|99|B
Tom|49|C

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM students
   ...> WHERE age > 4;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM students;
1|Lez|3|1
4|Crazy|3|4


sqlite> SELECT students.name, students.age, grades.letters
