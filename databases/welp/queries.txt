You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews
   ...> LEFT JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
1|4|good|1|1|1|Crazy LLC|1|James|John
2|2|ok|3|3|3|Cream LLC|3|Fill|Crazu
3|3|eh|2|2|2|Tomson LLC|2|Tom|Kar

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews
   ...> LEFT JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
4|good|Crazy LLC|James|John
2|ok|Cream LLC|Fill|Crazu
3|eh|Tomson LLC|Tom|Kar

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews
   ...> LEFT JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name = "Crazy LLC"
   ...> GROUP BY businesses.name;
4|good|Crazy LLC|James|John
