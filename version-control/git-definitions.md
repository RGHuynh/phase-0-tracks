# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

* version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file over time and allow
the user to recall specific version.

* branch is an extension of the master file. It allows the programmer to safely work on the project
without affecting the master project.

* Commit is a saved snapshot with description of the project you're working on. A good commit message is
descriptive.

* Merge conflict is when there is an issue between the file you're combining and the master file. Usually this happens when someone change a line that is the sane as the master code original script.
